New round assigner.  This will replace `sessionCoordinator` for a new approach to player selection.
The main method is `generateRoundAssignment`

Algorithm

Multi-Iteration Round Optimization:
- Generate 3 complete round assignments
- Calculate total freshness score for each round (sum of all court scores)
- Select the round assignment with the lowest total freshness score
- This ensures we get the freshest possible matchups across the entire round

Input:
- Session
- List of available players, including paused players (sitting out players are already calculated)
- List of paused players (these are ineligible)

Internal Data:
- list of playing players (sitouts are already decided)
- partner map
Function:
- get fixed partner (player)

Get list of courts, ordered by minimum rating
Iterate over courts, assigning players to each court based on the following.

Get list of eligible players for court - account for court minimum rating

Choose serve player1 - select by:
    - create list: players with least games on this court (ensure fairness on rated court)
    - tiebreak: select random from list

Update list of eligible players for court (remove player1)

Choose serve player2 - select by:
    - player1 has fixed partner? -> becomes player2 (done)
    - calculate partner scores:
        - for all remaining players -> create list: number of times partnered with player1
          tiebreak 1 (avoid consecutive partnering):
              - filter out player1's last partner (soft constraint: keep all if no alternatives)
          tiebreak 2 (court fairness):
              - create list: least games on this court (if rated)
              - list > 1? random select from list

Update list of eligible players for court (remove player2)

Choose receive player3 - select by:
    - calculate "opponent score":
         - for each eligible player, generate a list weighted towards unseen players:
             - for each of player1 and player2:
                 - base score = 2 * number of times partnered with + 2 * number of times opponent (using factor of 2 here to weigh player1/player2)
             - add recency penalty (soft constraint):
                 - if player is in player1's lastOpponentIds: add recency penalty
                 - if player is in player2's lastOpponentIds: add recency penalty
    - select player3 by lowest opponent score (base + recency penalty)

Update list of eligible players for court (remove player3)

Choose receive player4 - select by:
    - player3 has partner? -> becomes player4 (done)
    - calculate partner scores:
        - for all remaining players -> create list: number of times partnered with player3
          tiebreak 1 (avoid consecutive partnering):
              - filter out player3's last partner (soft constraint: keep all if no alternatives)
          tiebreak 2 (court fairness):
              - least games on this court (if court is rated)
          tiebreak 3 (minimax with recency penalty):
              - for each candidate, calculate total interactions (partners + opponents) with all 3 players (player1, player2, player3)
              - for each candidate, find their maximum interaction count among the 3 players
              - add recency penalty (soft constraint):
                  - if candidate was player1's last partner or opponent
                  - if candidate was player2's last partner or opponent
                  - if candidate was player3's last partner or opponent
              - select candidate(s) with the lowest score (max interactions + recency penalty)
              - random select if still tied

Proceed to next court.
